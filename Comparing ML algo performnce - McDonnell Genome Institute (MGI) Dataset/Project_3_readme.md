Step 1 -  Clone git repository in your local system
"git clone https://github.com/griffithlab/DeepSVR/"

Step 2 - From "Comparing ML algo performnce - McDonnell Genome Institute (MGI) Dataset/source", copy the source files "Random Forest.ipynb","Gradient Boosting.ipynb" and "Features Comparison.ipynb" and put them into the DeepSVR folder, the same location where the folder "Data" is present.

Step 3 - Run "Random Forest.ipynb" and "Gradient Boosting.ipynb" at first and then run "Features Comparison.ipynb" file after that.
